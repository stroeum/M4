# M4

Updated M4 by Kellen in 2021.


## Before running
Make sure that in your ~/.bashrc you are exporting the proper PETSC_DIR

	Locally:
		petsc_dir ~= /usr/lib/petsc-<version>

	Blueshark:
		petsc_dir ~= export/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.1.0/petsc-...


makefile must be tailored to the specific computer being used. (And rankfile if hyperthreading)

## Commands to run

	1.  make clean_data
	2.  make all
	3.  make run
	4. Optional: Can save data with
	    make n=<name> save
	    
	    Note: this will create a directory named SaveData which will hold all future saved data (This folder can be used for Matlab when analyzing data)

	Or, if on blueshark
	1. sbatch start.job


## Debugging information

Output directory must exist and must be manually created if it does not already exist!
(This should be changed in the future, such that the program automatically creates the directory if it does not already exist)

Seg faults:
	Most likely due to hardcoded directory pointing to the wrong place.
	The output, bin, and build directories must exist prior to running the mpiexec
	The input file, myctx.c, and the makefile contain hardcoded directory pointers, test these.
	This also depends where the program is being run from. Should be /M4, not /M4/bin

btl_tcp error on BlueShark:
	This occurs when the program is attempting to run on >1 node. You need to add command-line arguments to mpiexec that look similar to
	-mca btl_tcp_if_include eno1 -mca btl tcp,self
	The eno1 can be located using the ifconfig command. Beyond this, I don't know much about the error

Problem during Linking as part of "make all"
	May need to link a library using "sudo ln -s <library you do have> <library it's looking for and failing to find>
	Ex: sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python3 /usr/lib/python
